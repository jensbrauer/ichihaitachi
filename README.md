  included in the footer is also links to external resources where you can read the manga and watch the anime series.
  - This page has its own css stylesheet as much of the content initialy differed from the main page. This could probably be better organized.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

- The about section would be interesting to build out in order for users to contribute with content and upload artwork or link to video content that they think should be featured to describe Itachi.

## Testing 

Testing has been conducted and only one performance issue found through lighthouse remains unattended. Other then that, no unfixed bugs have emerged in the testing.

The most interesting problem was the page height. Managing to create a page size that enables each section of the page to be viewed seperately.

Text boxes are styled to fit screen sizes down to about 315px width.
